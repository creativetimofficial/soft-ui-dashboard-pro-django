# Automation: The Blueprint ensures that every time you push changes to your
# repository, Render knows how to deploy your services and infrastructure
# automatically. It removes the need for manually configuring servers or
# services every time you make changes to your app. You can manage
# deployments and changes using the blueprint, making it consistent and scalable


# The database is hosted on Render.
# You donâ€™t have to install or manage PostgreSQL manually because Render handles
# backups, updates, and scaling. You only need to define the database in your
# render.yaml file and configure your app to point to it using the
# DATABASE_URL environment variable.
