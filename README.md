> UNZIP the sources or clone this repository. After getting the code, open a terminal and navigate to the working directory, with product source code.

<br />

> Export `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment. The value is provided during purchase. 

This is required because the project has a private REPO dependency: `github.com/app-generator/priv-django-admin-soft-pro`

```bash
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'  # for Linux, Mac
$ set GITHUB_TOKEN='TOKEN_HERE'     # Windows CMD
$ $env:GITHUB_TOKEN = 'TOKEN_HERE'  # Windows powerShell 
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Install modules via `VENV`.


```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Edit the `.env` using the template `.env.sample`. 

```env

# True for development, False for production
DEBUG=True

```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Set Up Database

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Create the Superuser

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

<br />

> ðŸ‘‰ Start the app

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
